**Cloud-Barista Community actively contributes to multi-cloud technology advancement**, and we share documentation outputs throughout the development process, fostering a collaborative ecosystem for continuous innovation in multi-cloud technology.

Since 2019, Cloud-Barista Community has been researching and developing multi-cloud common platform technology. From 2023, we plan to expand to cloud migration technology based on multi-cloud common platform technology.

**Cloud-Barista's core frameworks have been providing essential common functions required for the operation and management of multi-cloud services.** Leveraging the combined strengths of the integrated multi-cloud infrastructure, it makes you facilitate the deployment, management, and delivery of various application services on a global scale. We promise that we will continue to improve our core frameworks.

**Cloud-Barista seeks to further expand its cloud migration technology** based on the core frameworks that have been steadily developed so far. We will take an in-depth look at all of the various IT assets (i.e. infrastructure, software, and data) and provide technology to migrate them in an integrated manner. We hope this technology will help you bring your IT assets to the cloud and accelerate your successful SaaS transformation.
