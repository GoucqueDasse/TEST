**OpenSW-SDI Community actively contributes to mobility-specific infrastructure technology advancement in response to the H/W aware support requirements of various mobility devices(SDV, UAM, Robot, etc.) in the future mobility society.** 
and we share documentation outputs throughout the development process, fostering a collaborative ecosystem for continuous innovation in software-defined infrastructure(SDI) technology.

From 2024 to 2027, OpenSW-SDI community will conduct research and development through a pipeline(development, implementation, operation, integration, and application) of software-defined infrastructure technology.

**Cloud-Barista seeks to further expand its cloud migration technology** based on the core frameworks that have been steadily developed so far. We will take an in-depth look at all of the various IT assets (i.e. infrastructure, software, and data) and provide technology to migrate them in an integrated manner. We hope this technology will help you bring your IT assets to the cloud and accelerate your successful SaaS transformation.
